# FizzBuzz Java procject
A short and simple Java project made for the purpose of helping me learn to set up and run Java using IntelliJ.

The program is designed to print integers from 1 to 100, but print “Fizz” if an integer is divisible by three, “Buzz” if an integer is divisible by five, and “FizzBuzz” if an integer is divisible by both three and five
